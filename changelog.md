# 🆕 Ocean Blocker — Version 2.0

## ✅ What’s New in V2.0

- 🔒 Added full support for blocking:
  - `detect.ac`
  - `echo.ac`
- 🧱 Hosts file blocking for all three domains (`anticheat.ac`, `detect.ac`, `echo.ac`)
- 🕵️ Stealth firewall blocking using resolved IPs for all domains
- 🧼 Minor code cleanup for readability and performance

## 🔁 Upgrade Notes

If you used a previous version:
1. Click **Unblock Hosts** and **Unblock Firewall Rules** in the old version
2. Replace it with the new `roblox.exe` from this release
3. Use the new version to block again — it will now protect against all 3 domains
